# Asset Types

Each asset in dScribe is of a specific type. The asset type indicates the purpose of the asset and comes with its own properties and layout settings.

## Properties

The properties configured for each asset type are managed via the Properties page. For more information, see [properties.md](properties.md "mention").

## Layout

Each asset detail page includes a General tab, on which the description of the asset and some key information such as the asset's status is displayed. Below the description field, the Properties configured for the asset type are listed. Properties are always grouped into a **Section**.

Administrators can create additional sections and rearrange the available Properties as desired. For more information, watch the video below:
