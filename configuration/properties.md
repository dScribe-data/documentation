# Properties

Properties can be used to introduce concepts specific to your organization into dScribe. They are used to enrich the documentation of assets, facilitate filtering and support granular access policies.

## Property Types

### Properties of type Dropdown

Includes the following property types:

* **Dropdown list - single select**\
  A list of values from which one value can be selected per asset.&#x20;
* **Dropdown list - multiple select**\
  A list of values from which multiple values can be selected per asset.&#x20;
* **Dropdown hierarchical - multiple select**\
  A hierarchical list of values from which multiple values can be selected per asset. Only leaf nodes (= the values without child values) can be selected from the list.

Properties of any of these types can be used to document assets, filter search results, define the context of Contribution Access Policies.

### Properties of type Text

Includes the following property types:

* **Single Line Text**\
  ****A simple text field without formatting options.
* **Rich Text Editor**\
  A text field with formatting options, the ability to add Mentions to assets or users and the ability to upload images.&#x20;

Properties of any of these types can be used to document assets.&#x20;

## Enabling Properties on Asset Types&#x20;

Each Property can be enabled to any of the asset types in dScribe. Once they have been enabled for an asset type, they can be rearranged in that asset type's layout. See [..](../ "mention").
