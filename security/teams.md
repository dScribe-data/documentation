# Teams

Each User can be assigned to one or more Teams.&#x20;

Via the assignment of [access-policies.md](access-policies.md "mention"), Teams define which permissions each User has in dScribe.

Teams are also used to indicate the ownership of assets in dScribe. For example, indicating that the Team 'Finance Stewards' is responsible for a Dataset 'G/L Account Overview'.
