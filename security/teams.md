# Teams

Each User can be assigned to one or more Teams.&#x20;



**Teams can be used to manage permissions**\
****Via the assignment of [access-policies.md](access-policies.md "mention"), Teams define which permissions each User has in dScribe.

**Teams can be used to manage asset ownership \[**_**beta**_**]**\
****Teams are also used to indicate the ownership of assets in dScribe. For example, indicating that the Team 'Finance Stewards' is responsible for a Dataset 'G/L Account Overview'. As long as a team is assigned as Owner of a specific asset, team members will have edit permissions on that asset.

**Teams and Single Sign-On (SSO)**\
****If integration with an external Identity Provider has been set up on your tenant (SSO integration), all users who log in for the first time via SSO will automatically be assigned to a default team. This team is initially called 'Data Citizens', but can be renamed. If available, you can easily recognize this team as the only one which is editable, but not deletable:
