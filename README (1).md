# Users

Users in dScribe are managed via the Admin portal. Users can be created manually or synchronised with your Identity Provider through Single Sign-On (see [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")).

When created manually, each User requires the following information:

* Name
* Email
* Password

Upon creation, users do not receive an email. You can share a temporary password or ask them to navigate to your dScribe tenant and click 'Forgot password?' in order to set a personal password.

Note that email addresses need to be unique. No 2 users can exist with the same email address.&#x20;
